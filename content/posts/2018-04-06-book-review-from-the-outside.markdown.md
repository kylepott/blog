[From the Outside](https://www.amazon.com/Outside-Journey-Through-Life-Game/dp/0062675478) is a nice memoir from NBA Hall of Famer, Ray Allen. I chose to read this book because of [this article](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/ray-allen-letter-to-my-younger-self) that Ray Allen published in the Players Tribune last year.  Allen is known for having one of the best work ethics in the NBA - his 18 year career proved that he did a lot of things right.  While the memoir details a number of conflicts and drama Allen experienced with teammates and coaches, I was particularly attracted to the book to see if I could learn more about Allen's habits.

Self-diagnosed as suffering from a partial case of obsessive compulsion, Allen emphasizes how commitment to routines and habits were instrumental to his success and longevity.  Allen really shares a lifestyle that we see many athletes emulating today: no alcohol, clean diet, plenty of rest, focus on stretching and recovery, showing up to every game three hours early.

There are some sneaky good lessons relevant to professional success: making unpopular choices doesn't mean they are wrong, most people are rooting against you, not for you, it's not that most people aren't willing to do the work, it's that most people aren't willing to do the work when it gets really hard - _stick-to-it-iveness_.  There are many similarities to one of my all time favorite books, _[The Slight Edge](https://www.amazon.com/Slight-Edge-Turning-Disciplines-Massive/dp/193594486X).  _This was an excellent book that I recommend.  Sports fans will enjoy it.
