A book as big as your head![/caption]_Divine Direction: 7 Decisions That Will Change Your Life_ written by Craig Groeschel broke down seven decisions you need to make: Stop, Start, Go, Stay, Serve, Connect, and Trust.  The book interweaves well-known biblical stories to demonstrate aspects of the decision.  Overall, this book was topical and a quick read, and a good tool to do some self reflection.  The seven decisions, in general, are good things to keep in mind day-to-day. 
Unfortunately, the book lacks depth and substance. I can't recommend it.
