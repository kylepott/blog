A quick note to mention I authored my first open source project today.  Not only was it a great chance to breathe some life into an [old project of mine](https://lifehacker.com/274317/turbocharge-your-terminal), but a chance to officially get comfortable using Git and GitHub.  More work and learning to do, but I am very proud to have a working (on Linux, anyway) terminal configuration utility.  I have included a todo file to capture the enhancements I plan to make. Enjoy!

TurboTerm is a simple terminal configuration file that makes the terminal more user friendly and welcoming to novices.
