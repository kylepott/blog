**The Challenge:**  WordPress.com used to have a finite set of features, all developed by us. We have now introduced the ability for customers to use 55,000+ plugins and themes from the broader WordPress community, and they still expect us to support whatever happens to their site. How should we develop a program to increase customer satisfaction in their interactions with our 350+ support agents?

_TLDR; Always,** the customer**.  Implement change incrementally.  Use data.  Raise the base of knowledge.  Bifurcate the operation.  Improve the product.  Engage the community._







**First and always, the customer**.







_"They still expect us to support whatever happens to their site."_







What matters most is addressing what customers need from us. Then, we need to assess and determine if this is an incremental change (small, no big deal)?  Or is what's required to meet customer needs a revolution (a big, big deal)?  This problem fits somewhere in the middle I expect.







**My n of 1:**  I've been thinking about this problem since last summer when I wrote about my [personal experience](https://technicalagain.com/2018/05/12/build-an-ecommerce-website/) with WooCommerce.







<blockquote>After getting reasonably familiar with WooCommerce and participating in the community I noticed that it is not uncommon for administrators to have up to 30 or 40 different plug-ins running for a single WooCommerce site. That makes debugging really hard, keeping the plug-ins up-to-date almost impossible, and adds a lot more opportunities for defects and breach. Room for improvement, I think, for sure.

**Be human.  Start with people. Listen first.**







From what I've read about the Automattic culture, I'm guessing the Happiness Engineers have been debating and brainstorming what to do on this issue for some time.  We probably have a well thought out foundation to start from.  Listening is a great place to start. But, you didn't ask for the Happiness Engineers' thoughts, you asked for mine.  So here we go...







**Avoid artificial "burning platforms."  
**In my experience, incremental change initiatives are most palatable. From what I can tell, incremental improvements seem congruent with the way people think and act within Automattic.  It's in the creed, "I know there's no such thing as status quo." It's not always possible, but in this case,  we should avoid creating a burning platform for the next evolution in support service we need to provide.  Drumming up an artificial existential threat is not effective at sustaining meaningful change unless there actually _is_ a serious competitive threat looming.







There's a little bit of self actualization we need to acknowledge up front as part of this recommendation, too. It doesn't much matter what we used to do, the situation has changed. It matters what we can do for our customers.  Today.  Now.  What got us here, may not get us there.







To raise customer satisfaction, let's start by examining the operation and outlining our assumptions. 







**Key Drivers of Customer Satisfaction**







1a.) Speed to resolution with empathy. _Do I feel taken care of promptly? _  
1b.) Quality and permanence of the solution. _Is my problem really fixed? For good?_







**Problem Statements and Goals of the Support Operation**







Both 1a and 1b can choke the operation.  





  * 1a: With more plugins and themes, there are more problems with fewer formulaic answers.  Support takes more time. _Have I handled this before? Is there a knowledge item? Do I have a predefined reply? Probably not._   * 1b: Getting to done is harder because the big universe of WordPress.com is now enormous.  Support takes more expertise.  Support costs more.  _Locating the problem is exponentially more complex, let alone solving it. Now it's not just our problems we're solving, but everybody's._





When we look inward at the objectives of our support operation we believe:







We must delight in speed and quality interactions with the customer.  The WordPress Happiness Engineers are a core part of the WordPress value proposition.  If they weren't, why would all employees spend a week in support each year?  Why are Happiness Engineers (and everyone at Automattic) so thoroughly vetted?  If the goal was simply to reduce cost, Matt could outsource the whole operation.  Delight the customer. **Always the customer.**







This isn't just about reducing cost, but _cost does matter _- a lot actually.







**Operational Solutions**

Use data mining to reduce the universe of plugins and themes to a prioritized list that support agents can service efficiently.





Use data and iterate.  Smaller is better.  From current analytics we should already know the most support-intensive themes and plugins.  Even though the universe is 55,000+, the top 1% of themes and plugins most frequently used, most often requiring support, should be knowable.  This data can be used to prioritize what the Happiness Engineers focus their learning on in support of the expanded services they provide.  
  






![](https://technicalagain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Untitled-1-1024x576.png)
By data mining we can create a prioritized approach to training to allow all Happiness Engineers to support a wider set of topics more effectively (themes, plugins, etc.) and we can create targeted learning plans and specialty teams where extra help is needed.





Bifurcate the operation on first contact.  If this can be done automatically, even better. Escalate high complexity cases to "specialty" Happiness Engineers for WooCommerce, Themes, and Plugins or additional areas where additional specialty is needed. This will reduce mean time to remediation, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce cost.  This is similar to my experience in insurance claims support known as FNOL - First Notice of Loss: route the claim using automation, handle the support issue on first contact or get it to a specialist immediately.  Avoid creating a workflow where customers have to explain their situation multiple times to different people.  Avoid long delays and silence while a problem is investigated. Customers should not have to follow up.   
  
Raise the knowledgebase incrementally.  By using data to triage and prioritize where Happiness Engineers focus their learning time, we can make sure every incremental touch gives us the greatest return on investment in terms of coverage of the universe of plugins and themes.  Imagine if each Happiness Engineer learned just one new theme and one new plugin each month.  With the right structure and approach to self-directed learning and documentation, that would cost very little and take an enormous bite out of the problem statement in 24 months or less.







"Self-directed" in this context is a short-hand to mean delivering development solutions in a way that meets the workflow needs of a globally distributed, asynchronous, skilled support staff. In alignment with the Automattic creed and culture, the intention here is to highlight development and training as primarily a personal responsibility, but the intersect with the L&D Implementor is to provide the right resources (the implements), packaged in the most consumable format, at the right time, based on the current and future business needs, to ultimately have a positive and measurable impact on the operation. In this case, the goal is to train effectively to expand support services and increase customer satisfaction. 







**Next Steps**





  1. Use data to analyze the most problematic themes and plugins.    2. Use this data to create an incremental learning plan to raise the base knowledge of all Happiness Engineers so they can provide expanded services without incurring much incremental cost.  3. Use data to determine which plugins, themes, and other configuration issues really require specialty knowledge or more time intensive examination.  Invest in growing the knowledge of specialty teams.  4. Create an escalation workflow to move work to the specialty teams. Demarcate what the Happiness Engineers handle and what gets escalated.  This will take some testing and refinement.  5. Develop a proactive communication plan that anticipates internal conflict between the Happiness Engineers and the specialty teams.  Hatch a plan from the get go that avoids the _us vs. them_ inherent issues that could arise when you split an operation into specialty teams.   6. Test, iterate, learn. Gather additional data. Keep learning. Keep testing.  Keep refining.





**Can WordPress, the product, help?**  
  
Yes. There are product backlog ideas that could be considered for WordPress that would make support easier - and as a result - cheaper.  I'll float a few here.  To improve customer satisfaction comprehensively, the solution is not just a people and a process issue.  It's not just a support operations "thing." There are substantial contributions that can be realized within WordPress itself.  Again, the Happiness Engineers are probably a rich source of suggestions like the following:







Generate more robust and helpful logs.  WordPress has a very lean event logging architecture, I am assuming it would be similar on WordPress.com. Even with debugging mode turned on, support can be lengthy and frustrating because event traceability is difficult.    
  
Build an option to automatically delete unused themes and plugins that are deactivated or unused for 30 days.  Minimize the unhelpful buildup that happens over time.







Improve automated backup capabilities so support can simply rollback instead of debugging.  Avoiding a problem is the best solution. Whenever possible, rebuilding a system is faster and cheaper than repairing a system. The integration with DevOps can help: knowing what changed, when, and having the ability to rollback that change. Even giving customers this ability could reduce service volume, too. More self-service! 







Consider strategic integration of plugins and themes that most users want. More in-demand features with fewer add-ons would be the goal.







There are additional revenue producing ideas nestled within these product enhancements that could be tested.







**Allow the community to help.**







The community already helps police and help make support easier.   Continue to engage the community.  If they're not already, the support teams can share feedback with the plugin and theme developers if they discover recurring defects and bugs.







Consider publishing standards in the Plugin Handbook and for theme developers to produce KIs and self-service support guidance to help others.  Imagine an endorsement badge, "Automattic's choice," that could be assigned to the most stable themes and plugins after the developers meet the quality and debugging guidelines Automattic publishes to assist support. 







**Closing**  
Tackle this opportunity by placing the customer at the center, surrounding them with a virtuous circle of people, process, and product, supported by the amazing WordPress community.







Thank you, sincerely, for considering me and my recommendations here.  I very badly want to join Automattic and contribute meaningfully through work I'm passionate about.
