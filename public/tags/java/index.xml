      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve continued my experimentation with the Metasploitable (msf2) operating system as well as the Metasploit framework. I&amp;rsquo;m now up to five, I think, total successful exploits. I will write about two more of them here. The first, most basic, exploit I wrote about previously took advantage of a misconfigured rsh-server.
My next two exploits followed the same pattern:
 Conduct an nmap scan to see what services are exposed. 2. Find open ports and search Metasploit for a highly probable exploit or exploit + payload to open a reverse shell with root access  I was successful in exploiting the IRC server running on port 6667 and Java server running on port 5432.</description>
