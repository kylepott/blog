      <description>By completing this exercise I learned that the best backdoor is one that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to install yourself! There are two backdoors that I opened up within the Metasploitable 2 operating system (msf2).
The most powerful and easiest backdoor was to login using the root shell, create a new superuser, and then add this user into the SSH list so that I could make use of the existing SSH server configuration.</description>

      <description>I continued experimenting with Metasploitable 2. Over the past few days I managed to gain access to the MySQL and Postgres databases and used net cat to dump the databases and export them.
Using a similar technique as before, I used a reverse shell exploit to control the host, I launched mysql, queried the database to view the users, and found that two users didn&amp;rsquo;t have passwords.
I then used the guest account to dump the tables into a zip file and used net cat to send the file from the host over to my attacker.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve continued my experimentation with the Metasploitable (msf2) operating system as well as the Metasploit framework. I&amp;rsquo;m now up to five, I think, total successful exploits. I will write about two more of them here. The first, most basic, exploit I wrote about previously took advantage of a misconfigured rsh-server.
My next two exploits followed the same pattern:
 Conduct an nmap scan to see what services are exposed. 2. Find open ports and search Metasploit for a highly probable exploit or exploit + payload to open a reverse shell with root access  I was successful in exploiting the IRC server running on port 6667 and Java server running on port 5432.</description>

      <title>My First Metasploitable Vulnerability, Exploit, and Fix</title>

      <description>In getting started with Metasploitable (msf2), I was looking for a simple first vulnerability and exploit to really try out and get some momentum in my learning.
A really simple nmap command let me know that a lot of ports were open. There&amp;rsquo;s a great deal of practice I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to put to the test through msf2. I started by noticing the unix login port 513 is open.
From there, I installed the rsh-client on Kali (sudo apt-get install rsh-client) to see if I could gain remote access using the command rlogin -l root ipaddress.</description>

      <title>Building a Hacking Lab</title>

      <description>I spent the afternoon yesterday building a local hacking lab. After installing Ubuntu and VirtualBox, I grabbed a copy of Metasploitable (msf2) as well as a copy of Kali. msf2 is a version of Ubuntu that intentionally has a number of security vulnerabilities built in to give you a chance to practice your offensive security techniques.
One adjustment I had to make was to tweak the VirtualBox settings to bridge the network connection for msf2 and Kali.</description>
