      <description>Update: I&amp;rsquo;m bummed that the Big Ten and NCAA tournaments were canceled. Subsequently, my trip to Vegas was canceled and therefore, there&amp;rsquo;s really no point in my model - at least for 2020. That said, it&amp;rsquo;s still a great learning opportunity and I finished the work, which is included below. _ The work here can serve as a good starting point for the 2021 tournament_ _where I expect my Illini will be a three seed and at least co-champions of the Big Ten.</description>

      <description>“Usually the team that scores the most points wins the game.” - John Madden
Update: If you&amp;rsquo;d like to jump right to part 2 of this series you can do so here where I turn the regression analysis into a really basic data science model.
I&amp;rsquo;m taking the first steps of an 18-24 month journey with a beginner&amp;rsquo;s mindset to establish and grow my data science skills. What better way to begin to learn new skills in March than by applying them to March Madness?</description>
