      <description>I continued experimenting with Metasploitable 2. Over the past few days I managed to gain access to the MySQL and Postgres databases and used net cat to dump the databases and export them.
Using a similar technique as before, I used a reverse shell exploit to control the host, I launched mysql, queried the database to view the users, and found that two users didn&amp;rsquo;t have passwords.
I then used the guest account to dump the tables into a zip file and used net cat to send the file from the host over to my attacker.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve continued my experimentation with the Metasploitable (msf2) operating system as well as the Metasploit framework. I&amp;rsquo;m now up to five, I think, total successful exploits. I will write about two more of them here. The first, most basic, exploit I wrote about previously took advantage of a misconfigured rsh-server.
My next two exploits followed the same pattern:
 Conduct an nmap scan to see what services are exposed. 2. Find open ports and search Metasploit for a highly probable exploit or exploit + payload to open a reverse shell with root access  I was successful in exploiting the IRC server running on port 6667 and Java server running on port 5432.</description>
