      <description>I completed the Programming for Data Science with Python nanodegree at Udacity. The program was outstanding. It was formatted in a way that I really like to learn: a short video lesson, a short text recap/expansion of the content, and then a portion to practice what you learned. This course had three main technical objectives and two capstone projects.
Focus 1: SQL, Beginner to Advanced
The first objective was to learn SQL.</description>

      <description>I stepped on the scale more than 1000 times in the past decade and then used Facebook&amp;rsquo;s predictive modeling framework, Prophet, to see what I will weigh in five years if I don&amp;rsquo;t make changes. At 5&amp;rsquo;9&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ll officially have a Dad-Bod when I pass 200 lbs. on June 28, 2021.
Note: I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help myself from using a click bait headline. The only thing Facebook has to do with this post is I used an amazing open source prediction library they created called Prophet.</description>

      <description>Update: I&amp;rsquo;m bummed that the Big Ten and NCAA tournaments were canceled. Subsequently, my trip to Vegas was canceled and therefore, there&amp;rsquo;s really no point in my model - at least for 2020. That said, it&amp;rsquo;s still a great learning opportunity and I finished the work, which is included below. _ The work here can serve as a good starting point for the 2021 tournament_ _where I expect my Illini will be a three seed and at least co-champions of the Big Ten.</description>

      <description>“Usually the team that scores the most points wins the game.” - John Madden
Update: If you&amp;rsquo;d like to jump right to part 2 of this series you can do so here where I turn the regression analysis into a really basic data science model.
I&amp;rsquo;m taking the first steps of an 18-24 month journey with a beginner&amp;rsquo;s mindset to establish and grow my data science skills. What better way to begin to learn new skills in March than by applying them to March Madness?</description>
