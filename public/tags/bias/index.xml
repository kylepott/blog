      <description>Update: I&amp;rsquo;m bummed that the Big Ten and NCAA tournaments were canceled. Subsequently, my trip to Vegas was canceled and therefore, there&amp;rsquo;s really no point in my model - at least for 2020. That said, it&amp;rsquo;s still a great learning opportunity and I finished the work, which is included below. _ The work here can serve as a good starting point for the 2021 tournament_ _where I expect my Illini will be a three seed and at least co-champions of the Big Ten.</description>
