      <description>Slide 5 or 6 Nimmit! can be played with an actual card deck
My clone of Slide 5 written in Python
I almost gave up and quit on this project. I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I stuck with it because the results were so worth it.
After playing the Slide 5 card game I thought it would be a great game to clone into an online game that can be played with friends over Zoom during the pandemic lock in.</description>
