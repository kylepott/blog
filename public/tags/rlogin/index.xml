      <description>In getting started with Metasploitable (msf2), I was looking for a simple first vulnerability and exploit to really try out and get some momentum in my learning.
A really simple nmap command let me know that a lot of ports were open. There&amp;rsquo;s a great deal of practice I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to put to the test through msf2. I started by noticing the unix login port 513 is open.
From there, I installed the rsh-client on Kali (sudo apt-get install rsh-client) to see if I could gain remote access using the command rlogin -l root ipaddress.</description>
