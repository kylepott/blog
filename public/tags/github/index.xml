      <description>I completed the Programming for Data Science with Python nanodegree at Udacity. The program was outstanding. It was formatted in a way that I really like to learn: a short video lesson, a short text recap/expansion of the content, and then a portion to practice what you learned. This course had three main technical objectives and two capstone projects.
Focus 1: SQL, Beginner to Advanced
The first objective was to learn SQL.</description>

      <description>I stepped on the scale more than 1000 times in the past decade and then used Facebook&amp;rsquo;s predictive modeling framework, Prophet, to see what I will weigh in five years if I don&amp;rsquo;t make changes. At 5&amp;rsquo;9&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ll officially have a Dad-Bod when I pass 200 lbs. on June 28, 2021.
Note: I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help myself from using a click bait headline. The only thing Facebook has to do with this post is I used an amazing open source prediction library they created called Prophet.</description>
