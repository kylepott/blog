      <description>I adding depth to an image and created a 3D look from a photo. This is another example of a project that can only be realized due to the amazing era we live - thanks to an amazing open source project on GitHub and the pay-as-you-go pricing on AWS.
Follow this post to add a 3D look to your own photos. You&amp;rsquo;ll need some familiarity with AWS EC2, AWS CloudWatch, and SSH/SCP to log in to your EC2 instance and move files back and forth.</description>

      <description>Slide 5 or 6 Nimmit! can be played with an actual card deck
My clone of Slide 5 written in Python
I almost gave up and quit on this project. I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I stuck with it because the results were so worth it.
After playing the Slide 5 card game I thought it would be a great game to clone into an online game that can be played with friends over Zoom during the pandemic lock in.</description>

      <description>Every day right at 4pm when I should just about be getting hungry for dinner and losing motivation, I get a text message from My Future Self. The text message reminds me of my weight for today and compares it against all of the other 1048 entries I&amp;rsquo;ve logged on my scale the last decade.
**My Future Self **is smart enough to compare my weight to the previous day to give some encouragement or tough love.</description>

      <title>According to Facebook, I Will Have a Dad-Bod on June 28, 2021</title>

      <description>I stepped on the scale more than 1000 times in the past decade and then used Facebook&amp;rsquo;s predictive modeling framework, Prophet, to see what I will weigh in five years if I don&amp;rsquo;t make changes. At 5&amp;rsquo;9&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ll officially have a Dad-Bod when I pass 200 lbs. on June 28, 2021.
Note: I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help myself from using a click bait headline. The only thing Facebook has to do with this post is I used an amazing open source prediction library they created called Prophet.</description>

      <description>Update: I&amp;rsquo;m bummed that the Big Ten and NCAA tournaments were canceled. Subsequently, my trip to Vegas was canceled and therefore, there&amp;rsquo;s really no point in my model - at least for 2020. That said, it&amp;rsquo;s still a great learning opportunity and I finished the work, which is included below. _ The work here can serve as a good starting point for the 2021 tournament_ _where I expect my Illini will be a three seed and at least co-champions of the Big Ten.</description>

      <description>“Usually the team that scores the most points wins the game.” - John Madden
Update: If you&amp;rsquo;d like to jump right to part 2 of this series you can do so here where I turn the regression analysis into a really basic data science model.
I&amp;rsquo;m taking the first steps of an 18-24 month journey with a beginner&amp;rsquo;s mindset to establish and grow my data science skills. What better way to begin to learn new skills in March than by applying them to March Madness?</description>
