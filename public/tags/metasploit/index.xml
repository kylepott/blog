      <description>By completing this exercise I learned that the best backdoor is one that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to install yourself! There are two backdoors that I opened up within the Metasploitable 2 operating system (msf2).
The most powerful and easiest backdoor was to login using the root shell, create a new superuser, and then add this user into the SSH list so that I could make use of the existing SSH server configuration.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve continued my experimentation with the Metasploitable (msf2) operating system as well as the Metasploit framework. I&amp;rsquo;m now up to five, I think, total successful exploits. I will write about two more of them here. The first, most basic, exploit I wrote about previously took advantage of a misconfigured rsh-server.
My next two exploits followed the same pattern:
 Conduct an nmap scan to see what services are exposed. 2. Find open ports and search Metasploit for a highly probable exploit or exploit + payload to open a reverse shell with root access  I was successful in exploiting the IRC server running on port 6667 and Java server running on port 5432.</description>
