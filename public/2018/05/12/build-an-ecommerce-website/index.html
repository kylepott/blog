        <h2>Build an eCommerce Website with WooCommerce</h2>
        <h5>May 12, 2018</h5>
        

    </div>

    <div align="start" class="content"><p><img src="https://technicalagain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-20180511192617-1249x620.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I spent the last three weeks designing, building, testing, debugging and putting the finishing touches on my first eCommerce website, complete with a full shopping cart experience and product purchase workflow.  One of my original <a href="https://technicalagain.com/what-are-we-doing-here/ground-rules/sample-page/">project goals</a> in launching this site was to learn how to take a payment online.  This turned out to be relatively straight forward.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I considered three possible approaches for this project: Wordpress with WooCommerce, Bootstrap with a shopping cart add-in, and Shopify.  I ultimately decided on WooCommerce for two reasons: there was an overwhelming number of different shopping cart options within the Bootstrap community.  Although they are reasonably well supported, they couldn&rsquo;t match the centralized level of community support available through WooCommerce.  The second reason I settled on WooCommerce was that the actual implementation of payment options were sufficiently abstracted from the code - which appealed to me.  Bootstrap is more customizable, but from what I could tell would require me to setup my own piping to test and establish the payment workflow.  Bootstrap may be more appropriate for a large scale legitimate online retailer, but seemed too complex than what I needed for a single product sole proprietorship.  I turned away from Shopify due to the recurring fee structure.</p>
<p>The installation of WooCommerce started by first installing WordPress, then adding the WooCommerce plug-in, and then using the guided WooCommerce installation process to pick payment options.  Originally, I decided to use Stripe and PayPal, but ended up backing off PayPal because I felt it was sufficiently redundant to the features included in Stripe.  Knowing data minification is a technique to reduce the possibility of breach I decided to just use one payment system and can always add in PayPal if warranted in the future.  WooCommerce has a very smooth installation process.</p>
<p>I finished by picking a theme and stylizing the site, integrating Google Analytics, customizing the product description and pricing, nailing down the cart and checkout workflows, and finishing with the &ldquo;after sales&rdquo; experience&ndash;which was basically just a follow up email.  I also setup  Google AdWords.  The pricing for Stripe is very affordable, something akin to 3% per transaction plus 30 cents and no recurring fees.  WooCommerce can make some improvements.</p>
<h2 id="learning">Learning</h2>
<p>This was a good and straight forward project. WooCommerce is satisfactory, but not a great product yet.  There were a number of features I&rsquo;d expect to be customizable right out of the box but instead required me to install additional plug-ins (some free and some proprietary) or do some hacking deep into the configuration files.  Three examples come to mind:</p>
<pre><code>  1. To change the text on the &quot;Add to Cart&quot; button to say &quot;Buy Now&quot;
  2. To customize the &quot;purchase confirmed&quot; email
  3. To rearrange where the price shows up--whether above or below the product description
</code></pre>
<p>I was also disappointed that WooCommerce does not have a built in visitor tracking/analytics or marketing package-s-requiring me to, you guessed it, install yet another  batch of plug-ins.</p>
<p>After getting reasonably familiar with WooCommerce and participating in the community I noticed that it is not uncommon for administrators to have up to 30 or 40 different plug-ins running for a single WooCommerce site.  That makes debugging really hard, keeping the plug-ins up-to-date almost impossible, and adds a lot more opportunities for defects and breach.  Room for improvement, I think, for sure.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have any real technical snags or frustrations, and I appreciated having the chance to learn about staging servers, testing the purchase process, applying a digital certificate (yet again), and a dash of search engine optimization and internet marketing.</p>
<p>It is truly amazing that we live in an era that a team of one guy can buy a domain name and hosting, get a digital certificate,  build a website and shopping cart, and can create an internet business in under three weeks for less than $80.  Eric Ries talks about this concept in his book _The Lean _<em>Startup</em> (<a href="http://www.kimhartman.se/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/the-lean-startup-summary.pdf">summary</a>) but it never really hit home for me how truly accessible technology is until I did this project.  We live in an amazing time!  This project would have been all but impossible in 1998 and still very, very challenging in 2008.  In 2018, I didn&rsquo;t even write a single line of code.</p>
