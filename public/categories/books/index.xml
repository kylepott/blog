      <description>From the Outside is a nice memoir from NBA Hall of Famer, Ray Allen. I chose to read this book because of this article that Ray Allen published in the Players Tribune last year. Allen is known for having one of the best work ethics in the NBA - his 18 year career proved that he did a lot of things right. While the memoir details a number of conflicts and drama Allen experienced with teammates and coaches, I was particularly attracted to the book to see if I could learn more about Allen&amp;rsquo;s habits.</description>

      <description>[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_124&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;quot;alignleft&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;quot;225&amp;rdquo;]A book as big as your head![/caption]Divine Direction: 7 Decisions That Will Change Your Life written by Craig Groeschel broke down seven decisions you need to make: Stop, Start, Go, Stay, Serve, Connect, and Trust. The book interweaves well-known biblical stories to demonstrate aspects of the decision. Overall, this book was topical and a quick read, and a good tool to do some self reflection. The seven decisions, in general, are good things to keep in mind day-to-day.</description>
