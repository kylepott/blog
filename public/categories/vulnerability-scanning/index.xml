      <description>I scanned my own Wordpress sites for vulnerabilites using a powerful command-line utility, WPScan. WPScan is a black box vulnerability scanner specifically for WordPress. It is a stark reminder why it is so important to minimize the number of plugins you use, delete the ones you have deactivated, and make sure you are keeping your software up-to-date. One simple little command: sudo wpscan example.com -u will list all the WordPress usernames, plugins installed, whether active or not, as well as all published vulnerabilities for the plugins, whether they have been fixed, as well as how to exploit them.</description>
