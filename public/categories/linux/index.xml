      <description>Been a busy summer, but I spent some time continuing the work I previously wrote about the brute-forcer, ForzaBruta.py.Â This time working through the Lynda coursework to iterate on the brute-forcer to add convenience and analysis capabilities:
 * Take screenshots * Capture the MD5 checksum to compare the file contents * Record number of words and characters in each file and the time to load * Filtering and coloring based on return code * Filter for only certain file extensions.</description>

      <description>I installed Kali Linux on a dualbooted MacBook Pro last week. The frst thing I did was delete unnecessary files on the Mac to free up space and then shrunk the size of the partition using Apple&amp;rsquo;s built-in Disk Utility. I then manually installed Kali on the remaining unused portion of the hard drive.
This wasn&amp;rsquo;t a particularly challenging project but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy either. The only real issue I experienced was related to my bootable USB hard drive.</description>
