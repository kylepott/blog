      <description>I did some preliminary experimenting with password cracking utility John the Ripper to test the security of my own root password. I started by installing John and dumping the /etc/passwd file.
sudo apt-get install john
unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow &amp;gt; mypasswd.txt
The mypasswd.txt file now holds a salted hash of my root password. I then passed this over to John to work its magic.
john mypasswd.txt
John is very powerful. I experimented with the most basic of cracking settings starting with single mode, then word lists and John would have moved to an incremental mode.</description>
