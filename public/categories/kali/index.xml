      <title>Graphing Intel with Maltego</title>

      <description>Maltego is a powerful intelligence gathering utility that allows simple and visual reconnaissance of a host, website, person, and a whole heck of a lot of other topics that can be extended with utilities available in the Transform Hub. I did some straightforward querying on my own infrastructure for technicalagain.com.
There are other utilities available to pull down some of the same information as Maltego, but none that I have come across that are as powerful outside the terminal and none are nearly so visual.</description>

      <title>Avoid Detection with Nmap Stealth Scan and Tor</title>

      <description>The nmap stealth scan -sS flag allows you to search for open ports by adjusting the TCP/IP three way handshake:
The handshake ordinarily is SYN -&amp;gt; SYN ACK -&amp;gt; ACK
The -sS flags change the handshake to SYN -&amp;gt; SYN ACK -&amp;gt; RST
Defined: Synchronize, Acknowledge, Reset
This makes it less likely, but certainty not impossible for an intrusion detection system to pickup the scan.
The best approach that I can think of would be to use the -sS flag and between each port tested use Tor to change IPs from within a regionally anticipated region based on the purpose and location of the target.</description>

      <description>Been a busy summer, but I spent some time continuing the work I previously wrote about the brute-forcer, ForzaBruta.py.Â This time working through the Lynda coursework to iterate on the brute-forcer to add convenience and analysis capabilities:
 * Take screenshots * Capture the MD5 checksum to compare the file contents * Record number of words and characters in each file and the time to load * Filtering and coloring based on return code * Filter for only certain file extensions.</description>

      <title>Information Gathering with DMitry</title>

      <description>DMitry is a nice little utility built into Kali. It&amp;rsquo;s a basic and easy to use utility, but not great. Usage is straight forward.
dmitry technicalagain.com
DMitry is worth the effort to simply punch in the command line but don&amp;rsquo;t expect great information back. First, just about everyone is using a whois proxy to conceal their personal information. Second, DMitry relies on search engines to try to find subdomains and email addresses.</description>

      <title>Install Kali Linux on a MacBook</title>

      <description>I installed Kali Linux on a dualbooted MacBook Pro last week. The frst thing I did was delete unnecessary files on the Mac to free up space and then shrunk the size of the partition using Apple&amp;rsquo;s built-in Disk Utility. I then manually installed Kali on the remaining unused portion of the hard drive.
This wasn&amp;rsquo;t a particularly challenging project but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy either. The only real issue I experienced was related to my bootable USB hard drive.</description>
