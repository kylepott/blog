      <description>Over the past several weeks I completed this Lynda course about Bash scripting. The course was great and I was able to put my learnings to use. I wrote two handy bash scripts: the first is an open source project on GitHub I created called LogWatcher. The second is still a work in progress, but can be used to scan database exports and system logs to identify if sensitive data is stored in plain text.</description>
